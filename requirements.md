- **Order Confirmation:**
  - Display an order confirmation page with order details and a unique order ID.
  - Send an order confirmation email to the user.

- **Order History:**
  - Allow users to view their past orders with details such as order date, products purchased, and total amount.

#### 5. Admin Panel
- **Product Management:**
  - Provide an admin interface to add, update, or delete products.
  - Allow admins to upload product images and manage product categories.

- **Order Management:**
  - Enable admins to view all orders, update order status, and handle customer inquiries.

- **User Management:**
  - Allow admins to manage user accounts, including viewing user details and deactivating accounts if necessary.

### Technical Requirements

#### Backend (Go)
- **Web Framework:** Use a Go web framework such as Gin or Echo to handle routing and middleware.
- **Database ORM:** Use GORM or another ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT for secure authentication and session management.
- **RESTful API:** Develop a RESTful API to handle frontend requests and perform CRUD operations on the database.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrate a third-party payment gateway like Stripe for processing payments.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for the backend logic to ensure reliability.

#### Frontend (React)
- **Component Library:** Use a component library like Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
- **State Management:** Use Context API or a state management library like Redux for managing global state.
- **Routing:** Use React Router for navigation between different pages.
- **API Integration:** Implement functions to call backend APIs for user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Form Handling:** Use libraries like Formik for form validation and handling user inputs.

#### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Schema Design:** Design a relational schema to handle users, products, orders, and cart items.
- **Indexes:** Create indexes to optimize database queries for better performance.
- **Transactions:** Use database transactions to ensure data integrity during the checkout process.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- **Product Reviews and Ratings:**
  - Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products.
  - Display average ratings and user reviews on product pages.

- **Wishlist:**
  - Enable users to add products to a wishlist for future reference.
